DISCLAIMER:
By using this software you acknowledge the dangers of certain battery chemistries and are aware that charging  and storing batteries can be an inherently dangerous activity. You further accept any and all applicable risk of charging batteries in your home, including using this software to charge batteries with a power supply, and acknowledge that this software comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY expressed or implied.

The intention of this folder is to contain charge profiles so that the TP3005P can be used as a universal battery charger. To enhance the safety of your charging experience, it is recommended that you purchase/use a 'Bat-Box' or similar container capable of reducing the risk of damage from a battery fire or other high-heat malfunction, and follow all applicable directions for safe use of the product.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eventually profiles for a variety of battery chemistries and configurations can be built up here. This power supply will pay for itself if you have a lot of different kind of batteries and can read/write Python.

Currently profiles are accessed with ini file because I'm familiar with them. But XML or YML is probably better because tree/heirarchy structure is more appropriate for this.

Here are all 3 for studying on a rainy day:
